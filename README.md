## 🚀 Overview

**CHEMIZZIC** is an end-to-end, full-stack AI chemistry learning, practice, revision, simulation, and exam preparation platform. Traditional chemistry platforms present fragmented static tables of formulas and molecular weights. CHEMIZZIC unites **generative AI reasoning**, **deterministic scientific computing**, **interactive SVG/Canvas physical simulations**, and an **adaptive mastery learning engine** into a single cohesive ecosystem.

Whether a high-school student tackling Class 11 stoichiometry or a postgraduate researcher investigating organometallic pathways and lithium-ion battery kinetics, CHEMIZZIC adapts to the learner's academic depth and guides them along a continuous learning loop:

```
ASSESS ➔ IDENTIFY WEAKNESS ➔ EXPLAIN ➔ PRACTICE ➔ SIMULATE ➔ CALCULATE ➔ REASSESS ➔ MASTER
```

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Chemistry education suffers from deep systemic bottlenecks:
1. **Disconnected Modalities**: Students read theory in one textbook, search PubChem or Google for properties, memorize organic mechanisms without curved-arrow intuition, and perform labs in isolation.
2. **Abstract Microscopic Phenomena**: Concepts like electrochemical double-layers, phase transitions, and electron flow during $S_N1$ vs $S_N2$ substitutions are invisible, leading to rote memorization.
3. **Condition Sensitivity**: AI tools frequently hallucinate chemical outcomes by failing to account for temperature, pressure, solvent, or catalyst dependencies (e.g. alcohol dehydration yielding ether at 140°C vs alkene at 170°C).
4. **Lack of Adaptive Differentiation**: High-school students and master's researchers are forced into one-size-fits-all question banks that lack intelligent prerequisite mapping and spaced repetition.

---

## 💻 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pranzalpha/CHEMIZZIC.git

# Navigate into project directory
cd chemizzic

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev

# Or run individual services:
npm run server      # Starts the Express backend on port 5000 / configured port
npm run client      # Starts the Vite development server on port 3000
```

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Google Gemini API Key for Chemistry Intelligence
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

> **Security Note**: Never commit your real API keys to version control. The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `.env` files automatically.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Execute the comprehensive automated test suite verifying all 22 phases:

```bash
# Run the complete test suite (Mechanisms, Cells, Conversions, Reasons, Flashcards)
node test-bundle.mjs

# Run TypeScript compilation check
npm run typecheck   # or: node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit
```

## 🏆 Hackathon Demonstration Flow (5–10 Minutes)

1. **Diagnostic & Persona Setup (0:00 - 1:30)**:
   * Open CHEMIZZIC and select an academic persona (e.g. *Class 12 - Board & JEE Aspirant*).
   * Take the 3-question diagnostic assessment in the **Quiz Arena** to initialize concept mastery.
2. **Interactive Cell & Battery Lab (1:30 - 3:00)**:
   * Switch to the **Daniell Cell / Battery Lab** tab.
   * Switch between **Daniell Cell**, **Lead-Acid Battery**, and **Molten NaCl Electrolysis**.
   * Adjust Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺ concentrations and observe the dynamic Nernst potential update and animated ion migration.
3. **Reaction Mechanism Explainer (3:00 - 4:30)**:
   * Navigate to **Mechanisms ⚡**.
   * Run *"Dehydration of ethanol to ethene"*.
   * Step through the mechanism using the **Next Step** button, inspecting carbocation intermediates and curved electron movement.
4. **Organic Conversion Lab & "Give Reason" (4:30 - 6:00)**:
   * Navigate to **Organic Lab 🧫** and execute *"Ethanol → Ethanoic Acid"*.
   * Inspect the *"Why This Reagent?"* card showing why alkaline $KMnO_4$ is selected over PCC.
   * Open **Give Reason 🔍** and enter *"Why does H2O have a higher boiling point than H2S?"* to observe the 3-part exam answer.
5. **Revision Flashcards & Mind Map (6:00 - 7:30)**:
   * Open **Flashcards 📇** to review high-yield 1-mark and 2-mark cards with 3D flip animation.
   * View the **Mind Map** to visualize hierarchical topic relationships.
6. **Teacher Analytics & AI Tutor (7:30 - 9:00)**:
   * Click **"Ask AI Chemist"** from any view to demonstrate seamless contextual question answering.
   * Open **Teacher Dashboard** to inspect classroom mastery distributions, weak concepts, and leaderboards.

## ⚠️ Limitations

* **Browser 3D Acceleration**: Complex molecular surface renderings depend on client WebGL capabilities.
* **Condition Ambiguity**: Reactions that yield divergent products based on undisclosed conditions (e.g., cold dilute vs hot concentrated $HNO_3$) will explicitly flag an `UNCERTAIN` or `CONDITION-DEPENDENT` verification status.
* **Offline AI Mode**: Generative explanations require an active internet connection to communicate with Google Gemini API endpoints; deterministic calculations and cached questions remain functional offline.

---

## 🗺️ Future Roadmap

* **[PLANNED]** WebAssembly integration of RDKit for client-side stereochemical SMILES parsing.
* **[PLANNED]** AR/VR lab simulation module using WebXR for immersive virtual laboratory experiments.
* **[PLANNED]** LMS integration (Canvas, Google Classroom, Moodle) via LTI 1.3 standard.
* **[PLANNED]** Voice-driven conversational Socratic chemistry tutor.
